# Results Summary

This document presents the detailed findings from the quantitative analysis of ICT usage among primary school teachers. The results reflect descriptive statistics, usage patterns, cross‑tabulations, and chi‑square significance tests.

## 1. Demographic Profile of Participants

The sample consisted primarily of:
- **Female teachers**, representing the majority of respondents.
- Most participants were between **46–55 years old**.
- The largest group reported **more than 21 years of teaching experience**.
- Employment status was mostly **permanent teachers**, with a smaller proportion of substitutes.
- Teachers represented a variety of specialties, with **general education teachers** being the most common.
- Participants taught across all primary grades, with a slight concentration in **Grades 1–3**.

These demographics provide context for interpreting ICT usage patterns.

## 2. ICT Availability and Usage Frequency

### 2.1 Computer Availability
- A significant proportion of teachers reported having a **computer available in the classroom**.
- However, availability was not universal, indicating infrastructure gaps.

### 2.2 Level of ICT Use
Teachers rated their level of ICT use as:
- **Moderate to high** for most respondents.
- Only a small percentage reported **minimal or no use**.

### 2.3 Hours of Use Per Day
- Most teachers used ICT for **up to 2-4 hours per day**.
- A smaller group reported **0-1 hours**, while very few exceeded this.

### 2.4 Weekly Frequency
- The majority claimed **everyday ICT usage**.
- Daily use was less common but still present.

These findings suggest that ICT is used regularly but not intensively.

## 3. Instructional ICT Practices

Teachers reported how often they used ICT for specific teaching tasks:

### Most Frequently Used 
- **Internet search** (overall usage frequency: 84%)
- **Using the computer as a teaching assistant**
- **Displaying audiovisual material**
- **Using educational material**

These practices indicate that teachers rely heavily on ICT for accessing information, enriching lessons with multimedia, and supporting instructional delivery. 

### Moderately Used 
- **Educational games**
- **Slide presentations**
- **Educational software**

These tools were used regularly but not as consistently as internet search or audiovisual resources. 

### Least Frequently Used 
- **Email communication**
- **Document creation (text processing)**

These activities were reported less frequently, suggesting that teachers primarily use ICT for instructional support rather than administrative or communication tasks.

**This pattern indicates that teachers primarily use ICT for **information access and presentation**, rather than interactive or student‑centered digital activities.**

## 4. Cross‑Tabulation Findings

Cross‑tabs compared ICT usage frequency with participation in ICT training programs.

### 4.1 Level A Training (Basic ICT Training)
Teachers who completed **Level A training**:
- Did **not** report consistently higher usage frequencies.
- Their responses across “often” and “very often” were **similar** to those of non‑trained teachers.
- They did **not** show noticeably fewer responses in the “never” or “rarely” categories.

Teachers without Level A training:
- Displayed **similar usage patterns**, with no clear shift toward lower usage categories.

### 4.2 Level B Training (Advanced ICT Training)
A similar pattern emerged:
- Teachers with **Level B training** did **not** demonstrate higher ICT integration compared to those without training.
- Usage frequency appeared **comparable** across both groups.

These cross‑tabs visually demonstrated that:  
**Training was not associated with increased ICT usage.**

---

## 5. Chi‑Square Test Results

Chi‑Square tests were conducted to determine whether the differences observed in the cross‑tabs were statistically significant.

### 5.1 Level A Training
- The **Pearson Chi‑Square test** did **not** indicate a statistically significant relationship between Level A training and ICT usage frequency.
- This means that teachers with Level A training were **not more likely** to use ICT frequently compared to those without training.

### 5.2 Level B Training
- The Chi‑Square test for Level B training also showed **no statistical significance**.
- Teachers with Level B training did **not** demonstrate higher ICT usage than those without training.

### Interpretation
Both training levels (A and B) showed **no measurable or statistically significant impact** on ICT usage in the classroom.

---

## 6. Key Insights

- Teachers generally hold **positive attitudes** toward ICT.
- ICT usage is **regular and often daily**, indicating a high level of integration in classroom practice.
- The availability of a computer in every classroom appears to **facilitate consistent ICT use**.
- ICT training **is not a predictor** of ICT usage frequency; trained and non‑trained teachers use ICT at similar levels.
- Teachers primarily use ICT for **internet search, audiovisual material, and teaching support**, with less frequent use for administrative or interactive learning activities.
