# 🎯 Project Overview 

The purpose of this study was to investigate: 
1. **The percentage of primary school teachers who use ICT in their teaching practice**
2. **The frequency of ICT usage in the classroom**
3. **The ways ICT tools are integrated into instruction**
4. **Whether teachers who attended ICT training programs (Level A or B) use ICT more frequently than those who did not**

The research followed a **quantitative methodology**, using a structured questionnaire and statistical analysis performed in **SPSS**.

## 🧪 Methodology 
### **Research Design** 
- **Type:** Quantitative, cross-sectional study
- **Data Collection:** Structured questionnaire (25 items)
- **Participants:** Primary school teachers in Greece
- **Period:** March–April 2022

### **Variables** 
- **Demographic variables:** gender, age, teaching experience, employment status, specialty, grade taught
- **ICT-related variables:** availability of computer in classroom, frequency of use, hours per day, weekly usage
- **Instructional ICT usage:** educational software, presentations, internet search, video/audio use, educational games, email communication, etc.
- **Training variables:** participation in ICT training (Level A / Level B)

---

### **Statistical Methods** 
- Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages)
- Cross-tabulations
- **Chi-Square tests** to examine relationships between ICT training and ICT usage

The full SPSS syntax used for the analysis is included in the file: `analysis_spss.sps`
