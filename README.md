# 🎯 Project Overview 

The purpose of this study was to investigate: 
1. **The percentage of primary school teachers who use ICT in their teaching practice**
2. **The frequency of ICT usage in the classroom**
3. **The ways ICT tools are integrated into instruction**
4. **Whether teachers who attended ICT training programs (Level A or B) use ICT more frequently than those who did not**

The research followed a **quantitative methodology**, using a structured questionnaire and statistical analysis performed in **SPSS**.
